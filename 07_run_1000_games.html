		b. How many games are lost on the first roll, second roll, â€¦, twentieth roll and after the twentieth roll?
		c. What are the chances of winning at craps? [Note: You should discover that craps is one of the fairest casino games. What do you suppose this means?]
		d. What is the average length of a game of craps?
		e. Do the chances of winning improve with the length of the game?
